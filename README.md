#Questions for the tutor

See the index.html and main.css files: 
Q1: Could you explain why empty inline-block elements behave differently from text filled inline-block elements?
Q2: In the video about media queries the teacher uses a css selector that does not work for me. He uses @media (max-width: 767px). I only get it to work when I use @media screen and (max-width: 767px). Why is this?
